/**
 * Tiny event bus for Claude Code lifecycle hooks.

 * The daemon's HTTP hook endpoint emits `('hook', agentId, event)` here for
 * every lifecycle event it receives. The Keeper dispatch layer (keeper-dispatch.ts) listens
 * so it can tell when an `ask_agent` turn has started and finished.
 *
 * Kept in its own module so daemon.ts (emitter) and keeper-dispatch.ts (listener) share
 * it without a circular import.
